The different periods may be dated as follows: ancient period from 650-1200, medieval period from 1200-1800, and the modern period from 1800 to the present. The medieval period may again be divided into three periods: early medieval also known as the period of transition from 1200-1350; high medieval from 1350-1700, including the pre-Chaitanya period from 1350-1500 and the Chaitanya period from 1500-1700; and late medieval from 1700-1800. The modern period begins in 1800 and can again be divided into six phases: the era of prose from 1800-1860, the era of development from 1860-1900, the phase of rabindranath tagore 1861-1941 from 1890-1930, the post-Rabindranath phase from 1930 to 1947, the post-partition phase from 1947 to 1970, and the Bangladesh phase from 1971 to the present."

    "details": "Aryan languages became widely spoken in the Bengal delta as a result of the Mauryas' invasion of Bengal in the third century BC. But the bangla language emerged from prakrit without any direct input from Aryan languages, via apabhramsa and abahattha. The 47 Buddhist monks' spiritual poems known as charyapada are the earliest examples of ancient Bangla still in existence. The language used in these hymns is known as sandhya, or twilight language, due to its limited comprehension. The hymns of Charyapada are valuable in terms of language and literature. The authors of the Charyapada hymns are known as the Siddhacharya, and they are Luipa, Bhusukupa, Kahnapa, and Savarpa."

    "details": "The Bengal delta saw the spread of Aryan languages as a result of the Mauryas' invasion of Bengal in the third century BC. The bangla language, on the other hand, emerged from prakrit, outside of the direct impact of Aryan languages, via apabhramsa and abahattha. The 47 spiritual hymns known as charyapada, which were written by Buddhist monks, are the earliest examples of ancient Bangla still in existence. The language used in these hymns is referred to as sandhya, or twilight language, because it is only partially intelligible. Both linguistic and literary significance can be found in the Charyapada hymns. Luipa, Bhusukupa, Kahnapa, and Savarpa are some of the Siddhacharya, or authors, of the Charyapada hymns."

Mariam’s blog is easy to read and written in a conversational tone, plus it’s still very active as of November 2019. Make sure to follow her active social media accounts below! In this blog dating back to 2013, chemist Dr. Kat Day (@chronicleflask on Twitter, Facebook) takes on popular trends and news headlines that are either using questionable science claims or sensationalizing good science. She does a great job going after relevant topics to the every-day reader including super-slippery toilet coatings, reusing water bottles and homeopathic consumer products. Her amusing and skeptical tone makes it easy to read and will keep you clicking backwards through the archives to catch up!"
